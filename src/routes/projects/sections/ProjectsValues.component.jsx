              The Experiential Development of Professional Wisdom
            </p>
            <p className="font-lato font-light">
              Student development of "so-called" soft-skills, professional
              knowledge, entrepreneurship, and even wisdom through experiential
              education is seen as a natural progression with age and with
              experiential activities. This project examines how learning from
              experience in conjunction with a strong academic curriculum can
              develop expertise in a skill and thinking area. Knowing the modern
              view of neuroplasticity, it also looks at factors such as
              engagement that produce brain and behavioral changes. Knowing
              modern neuroscience, it looks at cognitive-emotional integration
              as below.

              Cognitive-Emotional Brain Circuit Integration and Reflection
            </p>
            <p className="font-lato font-light">
              Reflection facilitates the integration of emotion with cognition
              in producing student maturity from experiential education. While
              focused on the neuroscience of brain areas and networks from brain
              scanner studies, this project also learns from other fields such
              as art/music, social psychology/sociology, philosophy, etc. A
              particular interest is in the two-way communication between
              unconscious (mammalian brain) and conscious (primate brain)
              decision-making brain circuits and its enhancement over time. We
              also are interested in parallels to mindfulness and growth mindset
              practices.

            <p className="font-lato font-light">
              Using experiential education thinking to promote students taking
              agency in working with diverse groups of college students for a
              diverse world is the focus of this project. Several members of the
              lab recently produced a book on this topic, using student and
              alumni stories to illustrate basic social neuroscience principles
              of relevant unconscious decision-making. There is no question that
              diversity/inclusion generally is a compelling issue of our time
              inside and outside of the college experience and is an ongoing
              interest of the lab.

            <p className="font-lato font-light">
              Applying lessons from experiential education and the above
              projects, the goal here is to better reach, engage, and promote
              active learning in all classroom students, ranging from those who
              are passionate about the topic to those who may lack confidence or
              are otherwise less engaged. We are currently using a balanced
              hybrid, flipped-classroom teaching model with group work and
              continuous student feedback in an introductory psychology class
              that the lab director teaches every semester and which has
              research assistance from lab members.
