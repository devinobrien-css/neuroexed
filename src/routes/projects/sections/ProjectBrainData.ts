      The crowning achievement of evolution is the development of the 6 layer neocortex that houses 
      our ability to perceive, act, and reason with a high degree of cognitive abstraction. Sitting 
      at the highest level of brain function, it exercises the power of speech and handles the facts 
      and theory learning seen in higher education. Research also indicates that it tends to perceive 
      itself as the source of all awareness often ignoring the functioning of lower brain systems 
      that our defining quote from Pascale calls “heart reasons.”

    description: `
      Sitting in the middle of the three brain levels, its limbic and motor systems generate the 
      motivated actions required to preserve the body's health (feeding when hungry) and it gives 
      pleasure and pain signals that can drive behavior (such as addiction). A tremendous amount 
      of logic exists at this level, is largely outside awareness, but can guide decisions (e.g. 
      in neuroeconomics). The integration of this “limbic logic” developed through direct 
      experience (internships, etc.) with more cognitive classroom-based learning is the lab's 
      main focus.

  REPT: {
    description: `
      Lying at the bottom of the brain, it controls simple life-sustaining reflexes (such as 
      breathing), as well as more complex patterns (e.g. lower motor control of walking).  It 
      also mediates evolutionary encoded actions like eye-tracking (vs the primate brain which 
      models the object's trajectory).  Although not much a subject of our lab's work, it 
      nicely illustrates the principle of levels of function in the brain.
