            The Stellar Research Lab is made up of an interdisciplinary team of
            neuroscience enthusiasts. A common interest in the importance of
            experiential learning and the brain basis of decision making unites
            us to explore this challenging yet exciting area.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because of our unique, oftentimes non-neuroscientist backgrounds,
            the lab is able to approach topics from nontraditional point of view
            to compose unique assortments of blogs, papers, podcasts and books
            for the fellow curious mind...
